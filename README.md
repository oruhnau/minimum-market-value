# The minimum market value of renewables
This repository has been prepared and used for the article "Ruhnau, O. (2020). Market-based renewables: How flexible hydrogen electrolyzers stabilize wind and solar market values. EconStor". It contains the code for the article's Monte Carlo simulations on the minimum value of solar PV, wind onshore, and wind offshore in the electricity market. The minimum market value is derived from the (uncertain) characteristics of hydrogen electrolyzers, which are shown in the article to help stabilize the otherwise declining value of renewables.

# Usage note
To run the jupyter notebook, I recommend [this tutorial from the Open Power System Data platform](https://github.com/Open-Power-System-Data/common/wiki/Tutorial-to-run-OPSD-scripts).
